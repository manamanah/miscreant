# [WIP] miscreant
Prototyping a Rogue-like card-based dungen crawler

This game idea was developed during the 2nd semester of my bachelor degree at FH Salzburg. If you are interested you'll find the original project which was developed in C# using Monogame [here](https://portfolio.mediacube.at/projects/2017-miscreant). For me Miscreant always was and has been a mobile game. Therefore, I created this project not only to rework my original game concept but also to become familiar with Android and Kotlin.
